# Precision
I frequently work on small scall items and have not discovered a way to set the default unit to millimeters in the Blender UI, so created a Blender addon that configures blender for "precision" millimeter scale modeling, and other defaults that I like but that blender doesn't remember.
#### Add's a tab named "Precision" to the Sidebar (Also referred to as the "N Panel") with a "Set mm precision" Button. 
#### To activate, click the "Set mm precision" button.
